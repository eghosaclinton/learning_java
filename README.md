# Learning Java

currently learning the java programming language with the Head first Java book, will document progress and write book projects here

## day ?

read the first chapter, really is just an intro to the java language and how it works(compiles to bytecode and runs on jvm)

also learnt how to write classes and what methods are; learnt how to write java control structures, and wrote two java programs (BeerSong.java and PhraseOMatic.java)

## day ??

read the second chapter and i have begun to understand what the OOP paradigm is all about, as the book gave a comprison, side by side, with a procedural example (OOP looks cool), turns out procedural programming is not the only form of programming haha

learnt a quality of OOP, inheritance, and learnt how to write classes w/ methods and instance variables(like ones where the main method is not located), testing those classes and i also wrote a game!(GuessingGameLauncher.java), found out that objects are stored on the heap(just found out about heaps), most java apps are shipped with jvm, `public static` makes a method/instance variables global and what `.jar` files are(they are basically bundled up java files)
